# Test Resolution Plan

## Overview
The recent refactoring of the codebase has led to several test failures. The codebase is currently functioning as intended, so the focus will be on updating the tests to align with the new code structure and logic.

## Plan

### 1. Component Rendering Issues
- **Action**: Review the component structure to ensure all necessary elements are rendered.
- **Steps**:
  - Identify missing elements in the test failures (e.g., `[data-testid="word-builder"]`).
  - Update the test files to match the current component structure.
  - Verify that all components are rendering correctly in the application.

### 2. Undefined Functions
- **Action**: Ensure all functions used in tests are defined and correctly imported.
- **Steps**:
  - Identify all undefined functions in the test failures (e.g., `filterValidCandidates`, `scoreCandidates`, `generateBotMove`).
  - Check the implementation of these functions in the codebase.
  - Update the test files to correctly import and use these functions.

### 3. Dictionary and Validation Errors
- **Action**: Review the dictionary integration and validation logic.
- **Steps**:
  - Verify the dictionary loading process and ensure it is correctly integrated.
  - Update validation logic in tests to match the current implementation.
  - Ensure that all dictionary-related tests are aligned with the new logic.

### 4. Game State Management
- **Action**: Align game state management tests with the current logic.
- **Steps**:
  - Review the game state management functions (e.g., `validateMove`, `applyMove`).
  - Update tests to reflect the current game state logic.
  - Ensure that all game state transitions are correctly tested.

### 5. Integration and Adapter Issues
- **Action**: Verify the setup and integration of dependencies and adapters.
- **Steps**:
  - Review the integration tests and ensure all dependencies are correctly set up.
  - Update adapter tests to match the current implementation.
  - Ensure cross-platform consistency in tests.

### 6. Performance and Consistency
- **Action**: Ensure performance targets and consistency checks are met.
- **Steps**:
  - Review performance-related tests and update them to reflect current performance metrics.
  - Ensure consistency checks are aligned with the new code logic.

## Conclusion
This plan outlines the steps needed to update the tests to align with the recent code refactoring. Each section addresses specific areas of concern, ensuring that the tests accurately reflect the current state of the codebase. Once all issues are resolved, this file can be removed.
