## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Engine Architecture Cleanup** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Purpose**: Comprehensive cleanup of game engine architecture to eliminate duplicate functions, consolidate validation logic, and maintain single source of truth
  - **Problem**: Multiple implementations of validation logic existed across different engine modules, creating inconsistencies and maintenance burden
  - **Root Cause**: Historical development led to deprecated functions, duplicated interfaces, and conflicting validation implementations
  - **Solution**: Systematic cleanup removing deprecated code, consolidating interfaces, and ensuring single source of truth for all validation logic
  - **Architecture Improvements**:
    - **Deprecated Function Removal**: Eliminated LocalGameStateManager, createGameStateManager, quickScoreMove, quickValidateMove functions that returned placeholder values
    - **Validation Consolidation**: Replaced duplicated validateMoveActions method with agnostic engine's isValidMove function for consistency
    - **Interface Cleanup**: Consolidated ValidationResult and ScoringResult interfaces by importing from canonical sources (dictionary.ts, scoring.ts)
    - **Backward Compatibility**: Re-exported types to maintain compatibility while eliminating duplication
    - **Code Reduction**: Eliminated 60+ lines of duplicate validation logic and placeholder functions
  - **Technical Benefits**:
    - **Single Source of Truth**: All validation logic now comes from one authoritative source
    - **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical validation behavior guaranteed across all platforms
    - **Maintenance Simplification**: Reduced code duplication makes future updates safer and easier
    - **Performance Optimization**: Eliminated redundant validation calculations
    - **Architecture Purity**: Clean separation of concerns with proper dependency injection
  - **Verification**: Challenge engine tests pass (14/14), existing functionality preserved, TypeScript compilation successful

- **Challenge Mode Game Rules Integration** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Purpose**: Integrated full agnostic game engine validation system into challenge mode to enforce proper game rules
  - **Problem**: Challenge mode was accepting any valid dictionary word regardless of game transformation rules (±1 length changes, move validity)
  - **Root Cause**: Challenge engine's `isValidMove` function was incomplete compared to the comprehensive validation in the agnostic game engine
  - **Solution**: Replaced challenge engine validation with agnostic game engine validation while maintaining architectural purity
  - **Game Rules Now Enforced**:
    - **Dictionary Validation**: Only valid dictionary words accepted
    - **Move Validation**: Word transformations must follow ±1 length rule  
    - **Character Validation**: Only valid letters allowed
    - **Minimum Length**: 3+ letter requirement enforced
    - **Duplicate Prevention**: Words already used in challenge rejected
  - **Architecture Benefits**:
    - **Single Source of Truth**: All game modes use identical validation logic from agnostic engine
    - **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Challenge mode behavior identical across web, iOS, Android, etc.
    - **Maintainability**: No duplicate validation logic to maintain
    - **Reliability**: Comprehensive validation includes all edge cases and rules
  - **Verification**: Challenge engine tests pass (14/14), web app compiles successfully, validation works identically to vs-bot mode

- **Challenge Mode Infinite Loop** ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - **Purpose**: Fixed critical infinite render loop in challenge mode that caused browser console spam and performance issues
  - **Problem**: Challenge mode was using both the agnostic challenge engine and web-specific useGameState hook simultaneously, creating conflicting state management systems
  - **Root Cause**: useEffect dependency on `actions` object that was recreated on every render, triggering infinite validation cycles
  - **Solution**: Removed web-specific useGameState hook from ChallengeGame component, now uses only the agnostic challenge engine
  - **Architecture Benefits**:
    - **Single Source of Truth**: Challenge mode now uses only the platform-agnostic challenge engine for validation and state management
    - **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensures identical behavior across all future platforms (iOS, Android, etc.)
    - **Performance**: Eliminated infinite render loops and unnecessary re-computations
    - **Maintainability**: Reduced complexity by removing conflicting state management systems
  - **Verification**: No more console errors, smooth challenge mode operation, all tests passing

- **Challenge Mode UI Feedback** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Purpose**: Fixed missing checkmark feedback in challenge mode when valid words are entered
  - **Problem**: Challenge mode was showing ✗ (X) even for valid word transformations, unlike vs-bot mode which correctly showed ✓ (checkmark)
  - **Root Cause**: ScoreDisplay component requires both `isValid: true` AND action states (add/remove/move) to show checkmark, but challenge mode was hardcoding empty action states
  - **Solution**: Integrated agnostic game engine's action analysis into challenge mode validation to provide real action states
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Action Analysis Integration**: Challenge mode now uses `calculateScore()` from agnostic engine to analyze word transformations
    - **Action State Extraction**: Extracts add/remove/move actions from scoring result for UI feedback
    - **ScoreDisplay Compatibility**: Provides real action states instead of hardcoded `{ add: false, remove: false, move: false }`
    - **Architecture Compliance**: Uses existing agnostic engine logic instead of duplicating action analysis
    - **UI Consistency**: Submit button behavior now identical between vs-bot and challenge modes
  - **User Experience Benefits**:
    - **Immediate Feedback**: Players now see ✓ when they enter valid word transformations in challenge mode
    - **Consistent Behavior**: Same visual feedback patterns across all game modes
    - **Reduced Confusion**: Clear indication when moves are valid vs. invalid
    - **Professional Polish**: UI behavior matches user expectations from other game modes
  - **Architecture Benefits**:
    - **Single Source of Truth**: Action analysis logic comes from one authoritative source (agnostic engine)
    - **Code Reuse**: Leverages existing scoring calculations without duplication
    - **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical UI feedback behavior across all platforms
    - **Maintainability**: Changes to action analysis logic automatically apply to all game modes
  - **Verification**: Challenge engine tests pass (14/14), web app compiles successfully, checkmark appears correctly for valid moves

- **Challenge Mode Score Display** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Purpose**: Hide score numbers in challenge mode while keeping action icons and checkmark for clean UI focused on word transformation rather than points
  - **Problem**: Challenge mode showed score numbers (base score + key bonus) which are irrelevant since challenge mode doesn't use scoring system
  - **Solution**: Added `isChallengeMode` prop to ScoreDisplay component to conditionally hide score numbers while preserving action icons and checkmark/X feedback
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **ScoreDisplay Enhancement**: Added optional `isChallengeMode` boolean prop to ScoreDisplayProps interface
    - **Conditional Rendering**: Updated right content logic to skip score number display when `isChallengeMode: true`
    - **ChallengeGame Integration**: Pass `isChallengeMode={true}` from ChallengeGame component to ScoreDisplay
    - **Preserved Functionality**: Action icons (+ - ~) and checkmark/X feedback remain fully functional
    - **Backward Compatibility**: Default `isChallengeMode: false` ensures existing InteractiveGame behavior unchanged
  - **User Experience Benefits**:
    - **Cleaner Interface**: Challenge mode now shows only relevant feedback (action icons, checkmark/X) without distracting score numbers
    - **Focused Gameplay**: Players concentrate on word transformation without irrelevant point calculations
    - **Consistent Visual Language**: Action icons and checkmark provide same feedback patterns as vs-bot mode
    - **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Eliminates unnecessary numerical information in puzzle-focused mode
  - **Architecture Benefits**:
    - **Single Component**: Same ScoreDisplay component serves both game modes with conditional behavior
    - **Minimal Code Change**: Simple prop addition with conditional logic, no duplication
    - **Maintainable Design**: Future ScoreDisplay improvements automatically benefit both modes
    - **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with optional prop typing
  - **Verification**: Challenge engine tests pass (14/14), TypeScript compilation successful, UI displays correctly with action icons and checkmark but no score numbers

- **Challenge Completion Overlay System** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Purpose**: Comprehensive overlay system for challenge completion and resignation with cross-platform sharing functionality

    - **Color Consistency**: Uses only game's 3-color theme (background, text, accent) with no additional styling
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **WordTrail Logic**: Modified wordTrailMoves calculation to show start word first, then played words chronologically, then target word last
    - **Accent Color Styling**: Added CSS classes for start/target words using special player types ('start', 'target') with accent color
    - **Share Text Parsing**: Added logic to separate step count from share content for independent display
    - **CSS Architecture**: Complete rewrite of overlay styles removing all modal patterns
    - **Responsive Design**: Maintained accessibility and responsive behavior with flat design

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Bot Locked Letter Rule Compliance** ✅ **VERIFIED**
  - **Issue**: Bot was not respecting locked letter rules and could remove key letters that should be locked for the next player, violating core game rules
  - **Root Cause**: In `makeBotMove()` function, bot was only receiving `keyLetters` but not `lockedLetters` or `lockedKeyLetters`, allowing it to generate moves that remove protected letters
  - **Solution**: Updated `makeBotMove()` to pass both `lockedLetters` and `lockedKeyLetters` to bot as combined `allLockedLetters` array
  - **Technical Details**: Bot's `generateRemoveMoves()` and `generateSubstituteMoves()` already supported `protectedLetters` parameter, fix was ensuring game state manager passes correct locked letters
  - **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track locked letter state during bot moves
  - **Test Coverage**: Added tests for single and multiple locked letter scenarios to prevent regression
  - **Verification**: Bot now respects locked letters and cannot remove them (35/35 bot tests pass, 9/9 game state tests pass)
  - **Architecture**: No breaking changes to bot logic or game engine, maintains fair gameplay where bot follows same rules as human players
  - **Files Updated**: packages/engine/gamestate.ts, packages/engine/bot.test.ts
  - **Commit**: ShipHip: Fix bot locked letter rule violation

  - **Build Verification**: Successful production build with no TypeScript errors

- **UI Fix: Mobile Viewport Height**
  - **Issue**: Game board was partially obscured by the browser's UI on mobile devices.
  - **Root Cause**: The use of `100vh` for the main container's height did not account for the mobile browser's dynamic UI elements (like the address bar).
  - **Solution**: Implemented a JavaScript-based solution that dynamically updates a CSS custom property `--vh` to match the actual viewport height. This ensures the layout adjusts correctly when the mobile browser's UI elements appear/disappear.
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Added `viewportHeight.ts` utility for managing viewport height updates
    - Uses CSS calc() with custom property: `height: calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100)`
    - Handles resize, orientation change, scroll, and load events
    - Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
  - **Verification**: Implementation complete with comprehensive event handling. Visual confirmation on mobile devices required.

### Analysis
- **Key Letter Randomness Algorithm Evaluation**: Comprehensive analysis of random key letter generation system
  - **Algorithm Location**: `packages/engine/gamestate.ts` - `generateRandomKeyLetter()` function (base engine, affects all platforms)
  - **Randomness Quality**: JavaScript `Math.random()` with uniform distribution, adequate for gameplay purposes
  - **Constraint System**: No letter repetition per game, excludes current word letters, pool degradation (26 → ~10-15 letters)
  - **Security Assessment**: Pseudorandom sufficient for games, not cryptographically secure but appropriate for context
  - **Progression Analysis**: Game start (22-24 letters) → Mid game (18-20) → Late game (10-15) → End game (5-8)
  - **Conclusion**: Current implementation appropriate for fair gameplay with sufficient unpredictability and game balance
