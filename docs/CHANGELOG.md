- **Task 0.2 Complete**: Basic CI/CD via GitHub Actions + EAS
  - GitHub Actions CI workflow with Jest + ESLint validation
  - EAS build integration for Android APK and iOS IPA (development profile)
  - Automated builds triggered on main branch pushes after tests pass
  - Build artifacts downloadable via Expo dashboard
  - EXPO_TOKEN secret integration for authentication
  - Build caching and dependency optimization
- Initialized Supabase project with database schema
- Added Row Level Security policies for data protection
- Set up user authentication triggers and functions
- Created word validation service with dictionary support
- Added word length validation based on previous word
- Implemented bot support with rule-breaking capabilities
- Added display mechanics for bad words and 1337 numbers
- Created comprehensive test suite for word validation
- Scoring module with core rules:
  - Letter addition/removal scoring
  - Letter rearrangement scoring
  - Key letter bonus system
  - Comprehensive test suite with examples
- Examples of scoring:
  - "CAT" → "CATS" (+1 for adding 'S')
  - "CAT" → "COAT" (+1 for adding 'O')
  - "CAT" → "BAT" with key 'B' (+1 for removing 'C', +1 for adding 'B', +1 for key letter)
  - "CAT" → "TACE" with key 'E' (+1 for rearranging, +1 for adding 'E', +1 for key letter)
- Bot AI v0 (Greedy) completed:
  - Bot now chooses the highest scoring legal move.
  - Simulates 100 turns without crashing.
  - Maintains <50ms average latency.
  - Tests confirm the bot finds the best possible move, using add, remove, rearrange, and key letter actions.
- Task 1.4: Local GameState Reducer completed. Implemented a Zustand slice for managing the current word, key letters, and locked letters, with actions for add, remove, move, and reset. Added comprehensive Jest tests for all state transitions.
- Task 1.5: Integrated the full ENABLE word list (3+ letters) into the engine. Dictionary validation now uses a comprehensive static word list loaded at build time. Updated all tests to use real dictionary data.
- Integrated a comprehensive cleaned slang dictionary (with definitions) from slang-working-list.txt. The engine now loads slang terms from a JSON file, ready for future use of definitions.
- Alphabet Grid Component: Interactive, animated, and documented 5x6 grid with color states and Storybook stories. Supports tap, long-press, and drag gestures. All code, stories, and docs complete and linted.
